# Summation

## Purpose

This project is the start of a *[Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)* (RPN) calculator that takes input from the command line.

This will eventually support the following post-fix operator:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponentiation (**)
- Modular division (%)

Development will follow these steps:

1. Read input from command line (complete).
2. Distinguish operands and operators.
3. Implement stack interpreter.
